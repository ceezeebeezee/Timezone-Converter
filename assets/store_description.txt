DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
------

Timezone Converter lets you select any date and time on a webpage and instantly convert it to another timezone — no copying, no Googling, no mental math.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Select a date or time on any webpage (emails, articles, calendars — anywhere)
2. Press Option+D (Mac) or Alt+D (Windows/ChromeOS), or right-click and choose "Convert Timezone"
3. Start typing a city name — the fast autocomplete narrows 280+ cities in real time
4. Press Enter — the converted time appears right next to the original text

WORKS EVERYWHERE

In editable text (Gmail, Google Docs, text fields): the converted time is inserted in brackets right after your selection, e.g. [Mar 26, 2025, 11:00 PM JST, Tokyo].

On read-only pages (news articles, documentation, wikis): a floating tooltip shows the converted time for 3 seconds near the selected text.

SMART DATE PARSING

Handles the way humans actually write dates and times:
- "March 26 10AM"
- "3/15/2025 2:30 PM"
- "15 Jan 2024 14:30 EST"
- "Friday, December 1st at noon"
- "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
- And dozens more formats

TIMEZONE-AWARE

- Displays proper timezone abbreviations (PST, JST, CET, IST — not "GMT+9")
- Automatically accounts for Daylight Saving Time (PST vs PDT, CET vs CEST, etc.)
- Your default timezone is auto-detected from your system — or set it manually in settings

FAST & LIGHTWEIGHT

- No external API calls — all conversion happens locally using your browser's built-in Intl API
- No data leaves your browser
- No account required
- Minimal permissions: only activates on the current tab when you invoke it

KEYBOARD-FIRST

- Option+D / Alt+D to invoke
- Type to search cities instantly
- Arrow keys to navigate results
- Enter to select — done

280+ cities across every timezone, including major cities in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and South America.
